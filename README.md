Colorâ€™s project: This project was inspired by Frontend Mentor project called the 3-column  preview card component. I put a spin on it by creating color cards, then I do plan on creating a color reference site, as I pick more skills and take more Frontend Mentor challenges.

I will also try my best to update on README with any updates.
